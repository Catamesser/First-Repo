# First-Repo
This is my first repository, I would be thankful for some feedback and ideas that i can add to it. Thanks!

Im new to this GitHub stuff, so dont expect to much other than that i would like to share here to you my first upload, it took me around 30min to come up with this idea and i thought why not show it to everyone, please fell free to add or change stuff you like/dont like its all up to you.
